##### The Simulation Project

The essence of the project is a step-by-step simulation of a 2D world populated by herbivores and predators. In addition to creatures, the world contains resources (herbs) that herbivores feed on, and static objects that cannot be interacted with - they just take up space.

The 2D world is an NxM matrix, each creature or object occupies a cell entirely, the presence of several objects/creatures in a cell is unacceptable.
